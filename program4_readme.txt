  When a methodDeclaration occurs immediately after a variableDeclaration
(no constructorDeclaration was found/parsed) a problem arises where the parser
beleives to continue as though it were still looking at variableDeclarations
hence why all my tests include a replaced line including a
constructorDeclaration. I was able to track this down to the vardec in my code
however I have run out of time for what I can put into this program assignment
and should in theory be now caught up.

  There are also some problems resulting in error handling when a segmentation
fault does occur. I havent tracked that down, and as explained in the previous
note, can no longer afford to put time into this assignment with my other
classes, two jobs, and school organization.
